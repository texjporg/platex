# platex

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/texjporg/platex.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/texjporg/platex)

The bundle provides pLaTeX2e and miscellaneous macros for pTeX and e-pTeX.

The bundle is a community edition forked from the original ASCII edition
(ptex-texmf-2.5). The GitHub repository

- https://github.com/texjporg/platex

is now maintained by [Japanese TeX Development Community](http://texjp.org).

The original ASCII edition can be obtained from:

- http://ascii.asciimw.jp/pb/ptex/

## Changes from the original ASCII edition

See the documents (platex.pdf, pldoc.pdf, platexrelease.pdf) for more information.

- Fix macros which are inconsistent with the latest e-pTeX
  (e.g. \footnote, tabular, \parbox, \underline).
- Fix several bugs in pLaTeX2e and ascmac.sty.
- Add platexrelease.sty. As with the latexrelease package, this
  package enables us to use the old versions of pLaTeX2e (from
  2006/11/10 the ASCII edition).

## Documentation

A brief exposition of pLaTeX2e is provided in platex.pdf.
The document can be obtained by executing the following commands:

    platex platex.dtx
    dvipdfmx platex.dvi

The comprehensive explanation of pLaTeX2e source is included in
pldoc.pdf. If you are interested in typesetting pldoc.tex yourself,
the following commands will be helpful:

    platex pldocs.ins
    platex Xins.ins
    sh mkpldoc.sh
    dvipdfmx pldoc.dvi

## Character encoding

All the text files containing Japanese characters in ptex-texmf are
encoded in ISO-2022-JP. This is because ISO-2022-JP encoded texts
are most suitable for the traditional pTeX engine.
